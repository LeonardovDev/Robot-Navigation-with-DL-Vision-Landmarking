# Autonomous-Robot-Navigation-using-Deep-Learning-Vision-Landmark-Framework

## Abstract:
Robot navigation requires specific techniques for guiding a mobile robot to a desired destination. In general, a desired path is required in an environment described by different terrain and a set of distinct objects, such as obstacles and particular landmarks. In this project, a new approach for autonomous navigation is presented using machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network to identify
markers from images and Robot Operating System and Object Position Discovery system to navigate towards these markers.
