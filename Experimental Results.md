# Experimental Results

When the codes are executed as mentioned above, the Kobuki was able to rotate, take multiple images and pass them to modified Inception v3 engine. Figure below shows the Kobuki rotating from its initial position, taking images at fixed intervals.

  <img src="Images/rotate_1.jpg" width="23%"/> <img src="Images/rotate_2.jpg" width="23%"/> <img src="Images/rotate_3.jpg" width="23%"/> <img src="Images/rotate_4.jpg" width="23%"/> 
</p>

Figure 8 shows the terminal in which `Inception v3` engine using TensorFlow framework identifies different objects from the image. In the terminal, the identified object along with its accuracy (score) can be seen.
